[10] - custom command permissions from gconfig
[11] - change how ls txt files are made because currently running it twice at once in 2 different guilds could cause issues
[12] - p/soundboard sounds are guild specific, make a seperate command for all soundboards
[13] - p/chatbubble options for the bubble being on the left, right, and bottom sides of the image
[14] - logs page removes content at the bottom after you've scrolled wayy past it
[15] - so apparently the end event of collectors is called when the bot is removed from a server so that means you're gonna have to fix a bunch of collectors that rely upon guild ids to remove them from lists

[17] - p/chatbubble can be used by replying, reference can be set with a p/setreference and used from right click > apps > thingy

[20] - triangulation page that would be similar to sebastian lague's intro thingy, just cuz its interesting idk. similar to the physics experiment.
[21] - rewrite p/random buildidea
[22] - 2 sanity = 1 ether, add this to the godroll calculator AND check to see if it can get higher ether n shit
[23] - messages for rate limit exceeded (err 429)
[24] - p/setprompt normal alias: p/forceprompt
[25] - rewrite command datas
[26] - p/composite aliases & fix file format not changing???
[27] - gpt prompt saving
[28] - guide page has source code links
[29] - p/peppers, pepper index which tells factoids about peppers
[30] - p/queue silence, disables the messages for changing songs
[31] - p/lastfm (probably just links to a page on the website similar to discord oauth page) which lets u link ur account, p/queue & playurl support for last.fm
[32] - p/playurl and p/queue download function rewrite, put into a voice module
[33] - website page which lists currently active queues, disableable in guild config.
[34] - pepperbot playground, honestly just remove the chat its buggy as shit and doesn't work
[35] - p/jak graph subcommand option (its missing, IDIOT!)
[36] - rewrite gpt script

to add to todo list:

REMEMBER TO DELETE ON PI: 
p/configure BUT ONLY ONCE THE CONFIG PAGE IS DONE!!!

p/update reply stuff and website stuff

**website changes:**

- fixed statistics page
- static fx only happens on load, not on focus. 

**actual content:**

- new p/prompt, houses many new commands relating to gpt prompts:
  - p/prompt set, equivalent to the previous p/setprompt with one minor difference
  - p/prompt generate, uses AI to "elaborate" upon a prompt you give it. you'll be suggested to use this when a prompt from p/prompt set is less than 15 words or less than 100 characters. 
  - p/prompt save, allows you to save a prompt under a certain name
  - p/prompt load, allows you to load a prompt with a given name
  - p/prompt get, similar to p/prompt load but instead of changing your prompt to the new one it only returns the prompt. 

**fixes/optimizations:**
