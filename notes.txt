**fixes/optimizations:**

- changed MANY logs to use log.debug instead of log.info as those were used purely for debugging purposes
- all logs are now logged to a "global" log file, site log viewer now has an option to view this
- fixed switching to "-" log level on site log viewer not updating previousLevel
- all embeds using the default_embed have the author URL set to the site
- removed assets.html it was fucking useless
