todo:

fix various errors

here's some common ones:
markovChain[word].push is not a function (what??????)

commands to run for update:

p/undeploy

p/pepperupdate even more small stuff:

new stuff:

- new p/refresh command allows me to refresh induvidual commands without restarting the bot
- new p/update command allows me to do all the stuff i do for updates in one command

general command changes:

- converted interactionOptions.get() type differences to be a switch case
- commands are now only cached once, increasing starting times significantly.
- constant json files are now no longer imported in every file, instead in just one. should decrease restart times (i have no idea if this even did anything tbh) 
- fixed new guilds recieving duplicate commands
- fixed some subcommands data being CommandData instead of SubCommandData

specific command changes: 

- hopefully fixed p/chatbubble being able to reply multiple times? (I HAVE LITERALLY NO IDEA WHATS CAUSING THIS???)
- fixed p/corrupt not replacing $s and _s
- p/vileimagery no longer reads the whole vileimagery folder every time you run the command

other changes:

- removed some more unused code
- dotenv is no longer configured multiple times
- fixed various reference errors that i never actually checked for

announcements:

i'm not gonna make any promises on this comin out soon because i probably have to rewrite a bunch of code for it (cuz the original code is horrid), but i'm workin on a way to configure guild configs. 
don't be suprised if i forget about it soon though.

also i'm gonna be using this kindof format for update logs now, i like it better it looks a lot cleaner

also, i'm gonna have to do a lotta testing for this, but i just got bun to run it without any erorrs, so i might be able to switch from node to bun.
