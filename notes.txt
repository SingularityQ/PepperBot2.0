commands:

p/update been a lil bited

**general changes:**

- hopefully fixed some errors from p/queue that did not affect anything other than clog my console
- optimized p/random pepper
- new p/random command: p/random message
- removed statistics caused by subcommands
- made p/help command list look significantly nicer, shouldn't take up an entire page of your screen anymore
- fixed messages not being logged for use by p/markov and p/markovold correctly
- removed misleading alias on p/soundboard "play" and instead gave it to p/playurl
- p/joinvc now supports joining channels by name, meaning p/joinvc hellhole will actually work now.

**shit on the todo list:**

- change p/markov and p/markovold to simply read all messages from a channel rather than adding things to a permanent log and then reading said log
- add p/corrupt image support
- redo the way replies are handled by the GPT script
- AI image processing
- fix p/queue resetting the page when refreshing
- add a p/embed setfootericon, setauthoricon, addfield, removefield, seturl
- remake p/reactionrole, the syntax is just uncomfortable to use

if you've got anything you want me to add to the todo list, go ahead and ask me and i'll consider it
