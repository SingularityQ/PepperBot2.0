for update:

to test:

shit on the todo list:

[1] - add p/corrupt image support
[2] - ai image processing
[3] - add a p/embed setfootericon, setauthoricon, addfield, removefield, seturl
[4] - fix p/queue (and future stuff) editing the message twice when collector stops
[5] - p/todo pages if list length > 15
[6] - peppersite statistics on most visited pages
[7] - using p/queue while p/playurl is playing converts it to a queue system
[8] - peppersite resources viewer
[9] - p/jak viewer
[10] - reminder / scheduling capabilities
[11] - p/notice multi-shard fix
[12] - custom command aliases
[13] - custom command permissions from gconfig
[14] - change how ls txt files are made because currently running it twice at once in 2 different guilds could cause issues
[15] - p/soundboard sounds are guild specific, make a seperate command for all soundboards
[16] - p/chatbubble options for the bubble being on the left, right, and bottom sides of the image
[17] - logs page removes content at the bottom after you've scrolled wayy past it
[18] - rewrite readme.md to include info about stuff like what the lib files do and the forking pattern
[19] - so apparently the end event of collectors is called when the bot is removed from a server so that means you're gonna have to fix a bunch of collectors that rely upon guild ids to remove them from lists ✅
[20] - add some sort of greeting message that tells people the features of the bot
[21] - p/chatbubble can be used by replying, reference can be set with a p/setreference and used from right click > apps > thingy
[22] - p/chatbubble warns you if the reply is ephemeral that favoriting it won't work ✅

to add to todo list:

p/update Statistical:tm:

- statistics page has been entirely remade
- statistics system has been overhauled to include more data than just the amount that commands are used
- p/statistics has been temporarily disabled because i dont feel like designing the embed right now

note: the overhauled statistics is currently lacking a significant portion of data, i kept as much as possible but the new stuff has zero data whatsoever.

**actual content:**

- default GPT has been swapped from 3.5-turbo to 4o-mini
- new p/gpt allows you to do several things relating to gpt: set the prompt (using normalAliases, your usage of this command will not change), change to using the old model, and get the JSON of your current conversation (used for debugging mostly)

**fixes/optimizations:**
