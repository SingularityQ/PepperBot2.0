todo:

fix various errors

here's some common ones:
markovChain[word].push is not a function (what??????)

p/undeploy

p/pepperupdate even more bugfixes / optimizations:
fixed new guilds recieving duplicate commands
hopefully fixed p/chatbubble being able to reply multiple times? (I HAVE LITERALLY NO IDEA WHATS CAUSING THIS???)
removed some more unused code
fixed some subcommands data being CommandData instead of SubCommandData
fixed p/corrupt not replacing $s and _s
p/vileimagery no longer reads the whole vileimagery folder every time you run the command
converted interactionOptions.get() type differences to be a switch case
commands are now only cached once, increasing starting times significantly. 
new p/refresh command allows me to refresh induvidual commands without restarting the bot
