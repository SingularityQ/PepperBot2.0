for update:

to test:

REMEMBER TO INSTALL CHEERIO ON PI AND COMP

shit on the todo list:

[1] - add p/corrupt image support
[2] - ai image processing
[3] - fix p/queue resetting the page when refreshing
[4] - add a p/embed setfootericon, setauthoricon, addfield, removefield, seturl
[5] - remake p/reactionrole, the syntax is ust horrific

p/update split the categories so the NORMIES!!! know what is actually useful to them

**actual content:**

- p/queue shuffle (self explanatory)
- moved around some stuff in p/info so it should hopefully look a little nicer
- p/statistics is now split amongst 3 fields similarly to p/help, so it should look a lot nicer
- pepperbot will now be extremely angry if you don't title your medal clips. he will also not accept commands that contain untitled medal clips. so title your fucking medal clips.

**fixes/optimizations:**

- removed an unnecessary part of the editMessage function that would realistically never actually be useful
- fixed p/todo trying to deferUpdate messages
- hopefully fixed p/queue clear from messages?
- removed a lot of unnecessary shit in notes.txt
