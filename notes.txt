[13] - p/chatbubble options for the bubble being on the left, right, and bottom sides of the image
[14] - logs page removes content at the bottom after you've scrolled wayy past it
[15] - so apparently the end event of collectors is called when the bot is removed from a server so that means you're gonna have to fix a bunch of collectors that rely upon guild ids to remove them from lists

[17] - p/chatbubble can be used by replying, reference can be set with a p/setreference and used from right click > apps > thingy
[18] - catch ytdl-core errors
[19] - projects page
[20] - triangulation page that would be similar to sebastian lague's intro thingy, just cuz its interesting idk. similar to the physics experiment.
[21] - rewrite p/random buildidea
[22] - 2 sanity = 1 ether, add this to the godroll calculator AND check to see if it can get higher ether n shit
[23] - messages for rate limit exceeded (err 429)
[24] - p/setprompt normal alias: p/forceprompt
[25] - rewrite command datas
[26] - p/composite aliases & fix file format not changing???
[27] - gpt prompt saving
[28] - guide page has source code links
[29] - p/peppers, pepper index which tells factoids about peppers
[30] - p/queue silence, disables the messages for changing songs
[31] - p/lastfm (probably just links to a page on the website similar to discord oauth page) which lets u link ur account, p/queue & playurl support for last.fm
[32] - p/playurl and p/queue download function rewrite, put into a voice module
[33] - website page which lists currently active queues, disableable in guild config.
[34] - pepperbot playground, honestly just remove the chat its buggy as shit and doesn't work
[35] - p/jak graph subcommand option (its missing, IDIOT!)
[36] - rewrite gpt script

to add to todo list:

p/update there's no specific category for this its just a bunch of random features and bugfixes i've been thinking about for a while

**actual content:**

- winter theme disabled
- statistics embeds now contain a link to the statistics page
- p/ask now has an image argument for slash commands
- p/gpt image responses now include the prompt used to generate the image as well as a warning that it will be deleted by openai in 60 minutes
- 4 new GPT tools:
  - get_user, returns user data when given a display/user name
  - list_channels, returns a list of channels in the server
  - get_channel, returns channel data when given a channel name
  - suggest, which forwards a message to me (can also be used for bug reports and some other general stuff)
- gpt prompt now gives instructions on how to mention users and channels

**fixes/optimizations:**

- fixed public logs for text commands showing the exact message content
- p/configure can no longer be used by bots (this allowed anyone to configure anything using p/force say)
- removed gpt responses for commands you can't use, they were inconsistent and broken and often unclear
- fixed conversations resetting if you type just "<@>"
- fixed conversation reset exceptions not working

i am aware that p/preview is broken and i lowkey just do not give a shit they keep making breaking changes to the dw builder api without announcing it :/
