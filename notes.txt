to test:

shit on the todo list:

[1] - add p/corrupt image support
[2] - add a p/embed setfootericon, setauthoricon, addfield, removefield, seturl
[3] - fix p/queue (and future stuff) editing the message twice when collector stops
[4] - peppersite statistics on most visited pages
[5] - peppersite resources viewer
[6] - p/jak viewer
[7] - reminder / scheduling capabilities
[8] - p/notice multi-shard fix
[9] - custom command aliases
[10] - custom command permissions from gconfig
[11] - change how ls txt files are made because currently running it twice at once in 2 different guilds could cause issues
[12] - p/soundboard sounds are guild specific, make a seperate command for all soundboards
[13] - p/chatbubble options for the bubble being on the left, right, and bottom sides of the image
[14] - logs page removes content at the bottom after you've scrolled wayy past it
[15] - so apparently the end event of collectors is called when the bot is removed from a server so that means you're gonna have to fix a bunch of collectors that rely upon guild ids to remove them from lists
[16] - add some sort of greeting message that tells people the features of the bot
[17] - p/chatbubble can be used by replying, reference can be set with a p/setreference and used from right click > apps > thingy
[18] - catch ytdl-core errors
[19] - projects page
[20] - triangulation page that would be similar to sebastian lague's intro thingy, just cuz its interesting idk. similar to the physics experiment.
[21] - rewrite p/random buildidea
[22] - 2 sanity = 1 ether, add this to the godroll calculator AND check to see if it can get higher ether n shit
[23] - messages for rate limit exceeded (err 429)
[24] - p/setprompt normal alias: p/forceprompt
[25] - rewrite command datas
[26] - p/composite aliases & fix file format not changing???
[27] - gpt prompt saving
[28] - guide page has source code links
[29] - p/peppers, pepper index which tells factoids about peppers
[30] - p/queue silence, disables the messages for changing songs
[31] - p/lastfm (probably just links to a page on the website similar to discord oauth page) which lets u link ur account, p/queue & playurl support for last.fm
[32] - p/playurl and p/queue download function rewrite, put into a voice module
[33] - website page which lists currently active queues, disableable in guild config.
[34] - pepperbot playground, honestly just remove the chat its buggy as shit and doesn't work
[35] - p/jak graph subcommand option (its missing, IDIOT!)
[36] - rewrite gpt script

to add to todo list:

REMEMBER TO DELETE ON PI: 
p/reactionrole
p/explore

p/update there's no specific category for this its just a bunch of random features and bugfixes i've been thinking about for a while

**actual content:**

- p/gpt image now has a 4 hour cooldown per user
- added p/info shard, which provides detail about shards
- added total guilds and total unique users to p/info bot
- removed p/reactionrole
- removed p/explore
p/reactionrole fucking sucked and is done better by literally every other bot with reaction roles and even discord's onboarding thing. also nobody used it
p/explore's visibility was disabled by default and really the only thing it offered was privacy concerns. people probably dont want their servers being joined without their knowledge. and again, nobody used it. 

**fixes/optimizations:**

i am aware that p/preview is broken and i lowkey just do not give a shit they keep making breaking changes to the dw builder api without announcing it :/
