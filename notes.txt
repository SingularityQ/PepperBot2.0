commands to run for update:

p/update some more queue stuff (dude i wonder how many changes i've made to this command holy shit ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)

**general changes:**

- removed string paged menu builders, they were stupid.
- merged the build function of paged menu builders into the constructor
- fixed p/cquery chatbubbles having undefind heights
- added a p/git log subcommand, returns a graph of the commits to the repo
- p/cleanup can now cleanup only specific sections
- changed p/update to use parseInt instead of Number because i was THAT bored

**the queue changes, as expected:**

- fixed p/queue add and remove not working with slash commands
- fixed p/queue refreshing twice when adding songs to it
- fixed memory leak with queues where it would try to update every queue message at once, now it only updates the most recent ones in each channel
- fixed queues adding the buttons back after they've been removed when they refresh
- merged p/queue add checks into one function, rather than the same thing copy pasted twice
- p/queue now displays the duration of whats playing in the title, i decided not to do a progress bar because the only way to do that would be to edit an absolute ton of messages, which would probably very quickly be used to make my internet suffer

**shit on the todo list:**

- add p/corrupt image support
- redo the way replies are handled by the GPT script
- AI image processing
- "saving queues" whatever tf that means
- have p/sendlog return only recent logs
- optimize the p/queue pages, rn it creates a new page menu every time the queue is refreshed
