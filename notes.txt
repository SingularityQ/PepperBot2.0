**new stuff:**

**general changes:**

- fixed diabolical events causing errors
- optimized the way in which references are handled by the GPT script very very slightly

**specific command changes: **

- added a resolution limit to p/chatbubble to fix a memory leak (its 4096px by 4096px)
- fixed being able to trigger a p/say loop by some weird fucking method i don't even know how to describe
- fixed p/markovold

**the queue changes, as expected:**

- removed some useless code from queue
- fixed queue subcommands being nonexistant
- fixed queue not looping
- fixed queue trying to play the sound twice when looping
- fixed queue not handling status correctly
- fixed queue embeds not being updated properly when someone uses the text commands instead of the buttons
- fixed fatal error caused by attempting to play age restricted videos from the queue
- fixed markdown-related syntax working in the queue embed (apparently was a side effect of the hyperlinks)

- added back queue event system
- extended queue response collector time by 5x (to 20 minutes, rather than the original 4. however, this is excessively long, so if yall start abusing this i WILL be lowering it.)
- added an indicator for when the queue stops collecting inputs
- queues are now hyperlinks, letting you just click on them to view it on youtube
- queue now displays what song is currently playing
