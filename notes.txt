[14] - logs page removes content at the bottom after you've scrolled wayy past it
[15] - so apparently the end event of collectors is called when the bot is removed from a server so that means you're gonna have to fix a bunch of collectors that rely upon guild ids to remove them from lists

[25] - rewrite command datas
[26] - p/composite aliases & fix file format not changing???
[27] - gpt prompt saving
[28] - guide page has source code links
[29] - p/peppers, pepper index which tells factoids about peppers
[30] - p/queue silence, disables the messages for changing songs
[31] - p/lastfm (probably just links to a page on the website similar to discord oauth page) which lets u link ur account, p/queue & playurl support for last.fm
[32] - p/playurl and p/queue download function rewrite, put into a voice module
[33] - website page which lists currently active queues, disableable in guild config.
[34] - create a module for playing audio to guilds ✅ (already had been done basically)
[35] - p/queue embed title has timestamps for end and beginning of song ✅
[36] - reaction diabolical event is AI based ✅
[37] - pepperbot playground, honestly just remove the chat its buggy as shit and doesn't work

to add to todo list:

p/update a whole entire TWO new commands... CRAZY...

**website changes:**

**actual content:**

- removed p/force dm, it's been broken for months and it violates discord TOS
- p/todo refresh function rewritten, lists are now put into pages of 15 items
- rewrote README.md, much MUCH simpler now. i dont really know what i would actually explain about it, and if it was anything about the source code that would just be yet another thing i have to keep changing.
- diabolical reactions are now AI based. multiple reactions may be generated. these take into account attached files as well
- queue titles now have a timestamp that shows when the next song will play

**fixes/optimizations:**

- fixed something with paged menu builders... tbh i dont even know what it was..
