to add to todo list:

p/update lotta diabolical event stuff, some website changes, etc.

**actual content:**

- new p/equipment allows you to easily calculate godrolls, get random equipment, etc.

**fixes/optimizations:**

- message logging for debug purposes has been changed to only log the first newline as to not spam my output when you execute commands with many newlines (such as p/configure or p/equipment)
