todo:

fix various errors

here's some common ones:
markovChain[word].push is not a function (what??????)

commands to run for update:

p/pepperpatch fixed diabolical events causing fatal errors
fixed queue subcommands just not working..?

p/update even more small stuff:

**new stuff:**

-   new p/update command allows me to do all the stuff i do for updates in one command

**general command changes:**

-   converted interactionOptions.get() type differences to be a switch case
-   commands are now only cached once, increasing starting times significantly.
-   constant json files are now no longer imported in every file, instead in just one. should decrease restart times (i have no idea if this even did anything tbh)
-   fixed new guilds recieving duplicate commands
-   fixed some subcommands data being CommandData instead of SubCommandData

**specific command changes: **

-   ~~hopefully fixed p/chatbubble being able to reply multiple times? (I HAVE LITERALLY NO IDEA WHATS CAUSING THIS???)~~ did not fix it, am not fucking fixing it, fuck this stupid fucking gif.
-   fixed p/corrupt not replacing $s and _s
-   p/vileimagery no longer reads the whole vileimagery folder every time you run the command
-   removed client import from p/info
-   fixed p/say being able to loop on dev version of pepperbot
-   chatbubble replies are no longer ephemeral. should fix some embedding issues
-   removed unused boilerplate from p/restart

**other changes:**

-   removed some more unused code
-   dotenv is no longer configured multiple times
-   fixed various reference errors that i never actually checked for

**shit on the todo list:**

- fix p/markovold causing an error
- add p/corrupt image support
- redo the way replies are handled by the GPT script
- AI image processing

**announcements:**

i'm not gonna make any promises on this comin out soon because i probably have to rewrite a bunch of code for it (cuz the original code is horrid), but i'm workin on a way to configure guild configs.
don't be suprised if i forget about it soon though.

also i'm gonna be using this kindof format for update logs now, i like it better it looks a lot cleaner

also, i'm gonna have to do a lotta testing for this, but i just got bun to run it without any erorrs, so i might be able to switch from node to bun.
