**actual content:**

- fixed build preview throwing an error on builds that don't use shrine of order
- there is now a very very very experimental and rudimentary oauth2 testing page, accessible using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1209297323029565470&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fpepperbot.online%2Foauth2%2Flogin&scope=identify+guilds)
- oauth2 doesn't currently do anything, in the future i plan to make a config UI as a p/configure alternative.

**fixes/optimizations:**
