commands to run for update:

p/update even MORE queue stuff (when will i leave this command alone? never!)

**general changes:**

- removed string paged menu builders, they were stupid. 
- merged the build function of paged menu builders into the constructor 
- fixed p/cquery chatbubbles having undefind heights
- added a p/git log subcommand, returns a graph of the commits to the repo 
- p/cleanup can now cleanup only specific sections 
- changed p/update to use parseInt instead of Number because i was THAT bored 

**the queue changes, as expected:**

- fixed p/queue refreshing twice when adding songs to it
- fixed memory leak with queues where it would try to update every queue message at once, now it only updates the most recent ones in each channel 
- fixed queues adding the buttons back after they've been removed when they refresh
- merged p/queue add checks into one function, rather than the same thing copy pasted twice
- p/queue now displays the duration of whats playing in the title, i decided not to do a progress bar because the only way to do that would be to edit an absolute ton of messages, which would probably very quickly be used to make my internet suffer
- fixed title not being displayed when queue is empty after it has been reset
- p/queue's embed no longer refreshes multiple times upon first being sent
 
**shit on the todo list:**

- add p/corrupt image support
- redo the way replies are handled by the GPT script
- AI image processing
- "saving queues" whatever tf that means
- have p/sendlog return only recent logs
- fix p/queue add and remove not working with slash commands
- fix p/queue resetting the page when refreshing

if you've got anything you want me to add to the todo list, go ahead and ping me and i'll consider it

**announcements:**

it's possible the queue changes might be buggy, i didn't test them quite as thoroughly as i normally do.
