commands to run for update:

p/update some more queue stuff (dude i wonder how many changes i've made to this command holy shit ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)

**general changes:**

- removed string paged menu builders, they were stupid.
- merged the build function of paged menu builders into the constructor

**the queue changes, as expected:**

- fixed p/queue add and remove not working with slash commands
- fixed p/queue refreshing twice when adding songs to it
- fixed memory leak with queues where it would try to update every queue message at once, now it only updates the most recent ones in each channel
- fixed queues adding the buttons back after they've been removed when they refresh

**shit on the todo list:**

- add p/corrupt image support
- redo the way replies are handled by the GPT script
- AI image processing
- p/queue shows duration
- p/queue buttons for remaining functions
