todo:

fix various errors

here's some common ones:
markovChain[word].push is not a function (what??????)
This action requires a webhook token, but none is available. (WHAT THE HELL IS EVEN CASUING THIS I LITERALLY PASS THE TOKEN ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­)

p/pepperupdate bug fixes / optimizations: 
fixed replies attempting to reply after a followup
adjusted GPT prompt SLIGHTLY, you will NOT notice a difference
p/pepperannouncement/patch/update/subupdate now publish the announcement, as in you can get the pepperbot updates in your very own discord server!
removed unused code for in text files, i decided it was never really a good idea
the sharding script now exports the sharding manager, allowing me to do whatever i want with it
p/playurl & p/queue error response is slightly more understandable, also now deletes the file if it was unable to download it
removed imports of 'client' in discord action script. should hopefully avoid future possible recursive imports. if anything is broken, please let me know. the only commands or functions this should affect are those that just send a message directly in the channel without replying, and those that dm a user.
increased depth of logged objects
fixed GPT being unable to download text files (i forgot to import a library)
also fixed the same issue in p/setprompt
