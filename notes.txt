[14] - logs page removes content at the bottom after you've scrolled wayy past it

[34] - pepperbot playground, honestly just remove the chat its buggy as shit and doesn't work
[35] - p/jak graph subcommand option (its missing, IDIOT!)
[36] - rewrite gpt script

to add to todo list:

p/update finally, after a very long time...

**The Great GPT Script Rewrite:**
the GPT script has been ENTIRELY rewritten, with many new functions. here's a list of new shit:
- gpt prompt adjusted (crazy, i know)
- created a tools system which allows pepperbot to execute functions with parameters. this is NOT OpenAI's official tools system, i've found that is abyssmally slow. 16 seconds per message slow. my system takes only 3 seconds. 
- pepperbot can now fetch websites (given he decides to)
- pepperbot can now search the web (also given he decides to)
- added audio description support (though from my testing OpenAI has told it that it can't hear audio so it doesn't tend to work well)
- image description while inside conversations improved
- text file processing improved
- improved processing for unsupported files
- several other optimizations to the GPT script have been made

a note about tools:
custom prompts CAN use tools, however he will not understand how to use tools unless you instruct him how to in your prompt. easiest way to do that is to copy and paste the part of the default prompt that tells him how to use tools from the source code.
**please tell me about any issues you encounter with tools!** if responses contain something like "$EXEC_TOOL: $, it's not supposed to do that. 

**other things:**

- message content & channel/guild/user names are no longer logged, making it much harder to accidentally leak your info or something like that

**fixes/optimizations:**

- fixed something with paged menu builders... tbh i dont even know what it was..
