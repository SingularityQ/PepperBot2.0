remember to delete on pi: p/pepperupdate, p/pepperpatch, p/soundboard, p/addsound, p/retrievesound, the deleted message logs, p/say, p/dmuser, p/joinvc, p/leavevc

shit on the todo list:

[1] - add p/corrupt image support
[2] - ai image processing
[3] - add a p/embed setfootericon, setauthoricon, addfield, removefield, seturl
[4] - fix p/queue (and future stuff) editing the message twice when collector stops
[5] - p/todo pages if list length > 15
[6] - make logs page only display 1 log and you switch between them and it only requests one at a time and only the bottom 200 or so lines
[7] - peppersite statistics on most visited pages
[8] - using p/queue while p/playurl is playing converts it to a queue system
[9] - somehow fix p/queue only retrieving 50 playlist items despite the limit being set to 150 (its probably google's thing i likely can't do anything about it)
[10] - peppersite resources viewer
[11] - p/jak viewer
[12] - reminder / scheduling capabilities
[13] - p/notice multi-shard fix
[14] - custom command aliases
[15] - custom command permissions from gconfig
[16] - p/queue play pauses instead of stopping
[17] - p/info subcommands for other varieties of info
[18] - change how ls txt files are made because currently running it twice at once in 2 different guilds could cause issues
[19] - p/soundboard sounds are guild specific, make a seperate command for all soundboards
[20] - p/chatbubble options for the bubble being on the left, right, and bottom sides of the image

to add to todo list:

p/update 

**actual content:**

- removed 4 diabolical events
  - specifically:
    - adobe stock heart eyes thingy
    - cerveza cristal
      - (both of those for being too taxing on my wifi, there was a noticeable drop each time they triggered)
    - "ur pookie" scott gerwick balloon gif thingy
    - It's time to feast!
      - (both of these mostly for being not that funny & taking up a lot of screen space)
- significantly reduced diabolical event rate by rougly 8x
- additionally reduced thread diabolical event rates by roughly 40x
- comparison of old rates to new rates:
    - emoji reactions: ~2% -> ~0.25%
    - regular replies: ~0.4% -> ~0.05%
    - thread creation: ~1% -> ~0.025%
- added 5 new diabolical events
- new p/random emoji allows you to acquire a random emoji
- logs page on the website now uses the new and updated style
- logs page now reads 150 lines at a time, inserting the next 150 lines each time you reach the top of the current content.

**fixes/optimizations:**

- fixed Infinite Duplication from p/restart sharder
- cleaned up p/configure
- fixed errorReply being declared too late in command executions
- fixed attaching image files causing gpt response errors
- gpt file reads now use the standard fixFileName function
- fixed p/embed having the content value required (some subcommands don't require it)
