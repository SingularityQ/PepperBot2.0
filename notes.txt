REMEMBER TO INSTALL EXPRESS AND MODIFY PREFIX IN CONFIG.JSON ON PI (AND ALSO TO UPLOAD CONFIG.JSON)

shit on the todo list:

[1] - add p/corrupt image support
[2] - ai image processing
[3] - fix p/queue resetting the page when refreshing
[4] - add a p/embed setfootericon, setauthoricon, addfield, removefield, seturl
[5] - remake p/reactionrole, the syntax is ust horrific

p/update 

**actual content:**

- p/queue shuffle (self explanatory)
- p/say will now send your attachments too
- moved around some stuff in p/info so it should hopefully look a little nicer
- p/statistics is now split amongst 3 fields similarly to p/help, so it should look a lot nicer
- pepperbot will now be extremely angry if you don't title your medal clips. he will also not accept commands that contain untitled medal clips. so title your fucking medal clips.

**fixes/optimizations:**
