p/update 100TH PEPPERBOT UPDATE ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶

**actual content:**

- USER. INSTALL. APPS.
  - i believe i have fixed most bugs relating to it, however since i didn't design these commands like this was going to happen it's very unlikely they will all work first try.
- new guild config option: useEphemeralReplies
- all command replies are no longer ephemeral by default, and only the ones where it is supported will be ephemeral if you enable useEphemeralReplies in your guildConfiguration
- many more commands can no longer be used in DMs (due to their functionality being useless or broken), here's the list:
  - p/embed send
  - p/force
  - p/random sound
  - p/setprompt
- added BaseCommandData.disableExternalGuildUsage (controls whether the command can be used in a guild the bot is not currently in). here's the list of commands affected by this:
  - p/force
  - p/random message
  - p/random sound

**fixes/optimizations:**

- updated node (v19.0.0 -> v22.0.0), npm, discord.js (v14.14.1 -> v14.16.1), and @distube/ytdl-core
- made p/vc join much more reliable with slash commands
- p/vc join now informs you of what vc was requested when it fails
- p/vc join now differentiates between invalid vc type errors and nonreal channel errors
- p/random jak & p/jak now have processing messages
- commandData now has default values for everything
- fixed p/eval saying nothing was returned if the result is falsy
- messages without channels are now replied to, but a warning is still generated
- p/chatbubble replies are no longer ephemeral
- p/markov is no longer ephemeral
- default guild config is now returned if a nonexistant guild config is fetched
- interaction options now have a scuffed "set" function, this should fix many commands
- fixed p/configure from slash commands
- fixed a typo in one of the warnings ðŸ˜¨
- fixed invalidInputTypes and invalidInputContexts
- fixed missing arguments for p/addsound
- partially rewrote README.md, haven't finished the rewrite yet but i've decided to make it contain info about how stuff works rather than how to make commands
