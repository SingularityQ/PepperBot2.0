[9] - reminder / scheduling capabilities
[10] - p/notice multi-shard fix
[11] - custom command aliases

[15] - p/chatbubble options for the bubble being on the left, right, and bottom sides of the image
[16] - logs page removes content at the bottom after you've scrolled wayy past it
[17] - rewrite readme.md to include info about stuff like what the lib files do and the forking pattern

[20] - p/chatbubble can be used by replying, reference can be set with a p/setreference and used from right click > apps > thingy
