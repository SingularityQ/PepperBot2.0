for update:

requires testing:
- queue can still download songs (download was changed to be mostly non-async)

commands:

p/update queue saving and loading (thas about it)

**general changes:**

- changed messageCreate's Promise.all to Promise.allSettled
- changed some promise executors to be not async because eslint was yelling at me
- removed any object.hasOwnProperty()'s because eslint was yelling at me
- fixed subcommands executed from slash commands being unable to accept arguments
- p/sendlog returns only recent logs (unless you tell it to return the whole file)
- updated deepwoken name pool
- fixed case where things that got a random deepwoken name could be undefined on rare occasion
- added a few more checks to make sure that shit actually exists so hopefully it won't spam quite as much
- added a few more checks to queue operations to hopefully avoid THAT from happening again
- fixed some args being shifted on functions in p/queue clear, remove
- fixed p/queue clear refreshing multiple times unnecessarily
- added a failsafe where if a fatal error occurs many times in rapid succession it will just exit

**shit on the todo list:**

- add p/corrupt image support
- redo the way replies are handled by the GPT script
- AI image processing
- fix p/queue resetting the page when refreshing
- fix random emoji reactions
- maybe cleanup p/queue a little bit cuz what the fuck was that

okay im trying to figure out what caused... uh... that... last night
my best guess
is that it took more than 3 seconds to ackknowledge something due to a lagspike or something
so some interaction was like "oh u didn't reply in time so we're gonna ignore all calls to it"
and then because it didn't return a response it got in an infinite loop of trying to do something with an interaction that it wasn't getting returned
but i mean thats just my theory because js sucks and the stack trace doesn't even tell me where its coming from
i mean one of them told me the stack trace and i'm like 90% sure i fixed that one
but the rest of them didn't

if something like that ever happens again,
please
just have everyone leave the vc
you could even just move to another vc
because that will stop the queue
i think
i hope 
i have no idea what happened ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
ill probably rewrite the queue again because of things
specifically the command
