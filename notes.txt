to test:

shit on the todo list:

[1] - add p/corrupt image support
[2] - add a p/embed setfootericon, setauthoricon, addfield, removefield, seturl
[3] - fix p/queue (and future stuff) editing the message twice when collector stops

[7] - reminder / scheduling capabilities
[8] - p/notice multi-shard fix
[9] - custom command aliases
[10] - custom command permissions from gconfig
[11] - change how ls txt files are made because currently running it twice at once in 2 different guilds could cause issues
[12] - p/soundboard sounds are guild specific, make a seperate command for all soundboards
[13] - p/chatbubble options for the bubble being on the left, right, and bottom sides of the image
[14] - logs page removes content at the bottom after you've scrolled wayy past it
[15] - so apparently the end event of collectors is called when the bot is removed from a server so that means you're gonna have to fix a bunch of collectors that rely upon guild ids to remove them from lists
[16] - add some sort of greeting message that tells people the features of the bot
[17] - p/chatbubble can be used by replying, reference can be set with a p/setreference and used from right click > apps > thingy
[18] - catch ytdl-core errors
[19] - projects page
[20] - triangulation page that would be similar to sebastian lague's intro thingy, just cuz its interesting idk. similar to the physics experiment.
[21] - rewrite p/random buildidea
[22] - 2 sanity = 1 ether, add this to the godroll calculator AND check to see if it can get higher ether n shit
[23] - messages for rate limit exceeded (err 429)
[24] - p/setprompt normal alias: p/forceprompt
[25] - rewrite command datas
[26] - p/composite aliases & fix file format not changing???
[27] - gpt prompt saving
[28] - guide page has source code links
[29] - p/peppers, pepper index which tells factoids about peppers
[30] - p/queue silence, disables the messages for changing songs
[31] - p/lastfm (probably just links to a page on the website similar to discord oauth page) which lets u link ur account, p/queue & playurl support for last.fm
[32] - p/playurl and p/queue download function rewrite, put into a voice module
[33] - website page which lists currently active queues, disableable in guild config.
[34] - pepperbot playground, honestly just remove the chat its buggy as shit and doesn't work
[35] - p/jak graph subcommand option (its missing, IDIOT!)
[36] - rewrite gpt script

to add to todo list:

REMEMBER TO DELETE ON PI: 
p/reactionrole
p/explore

p/update reply stuff and website stuff

**website changes:**

- redid the 404 page with the new style
- oauth2 tokens are now in headers instead of url vars
- a new /configure is In The Works:tm: but will remain unfinished for quite some time
you can still go there for... whatever reason..

**actual content:**

- hopefully improved reply context handling by changing the reply message role to user instead of system
- removed get_replied_message tool, it never did what i hoped it would solve anyways. 
- adjusted GPT prompt
- added argument for request_url tool to NOT remove script tags
- tool call arguments are now displayed while processing for debug purposes

**fixes/optimizations:**

- fixed "400 Invalid 'messages[2]'. Image URLs are only allowed for messages with role 'user', but this message with role 'system' contains an image URL.", this was caused by starting a conversation when replying to a message with an embed in it.
