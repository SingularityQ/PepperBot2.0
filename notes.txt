shit on the todo list:

p/update too many bugfixes

**actual content:**

**fixes/optimizations/small stuff:**

- added aliases "resume", "continue" to p/queue play
- removed aliases "add", "as" from p/addsound as they didn't make much sense
- added alias "addsounds" to p/addsound as it can now add multiple
- p/queue now subtracts from current index when removed index <= current index (yes i know that means that if you remove the one its currently on it says its playing the previous one but i don't care at least itll play what would actually be the next song)
- p/chatbubble now has a "processing" message to avoid discord timing out slash commands
- p/chatbubble now responds with an error message if fetching / putting the image through sharp throws an error
- a guild config is now created upon the bot joining a server if an existing one cannot be found
- there are now options in the command buider to disable certain input types (slash command only / text command only)
