to test:

shit on the todo list:

[1] - add p/corrupt image support
[2] - add a p/embed setfootericon, setauthoricon, addfield, removefield, seturl
[3] - fix p/queue (and future stuff) editing the message twice when collector stops
[4] - p/todo pages if list length > 15
[5] - peppersite statistics on most visited pages
[6] - using p/queue while p/playurl is playing converts it to a queue system
[7] - peppersite resources viewer
[8] - p/jak viewer
[9] - reminder / scheduling capabilities
[10] - p/notice multi-shard fix
[11] - custom command aliases
[12] - custom command permissions from gconfig
[13] - change how ls txt files are made because currently running it twice at once in 2 different guilds could cause issues
[14] - p/soundboard sounds are guild specific, make a seperate command for all soundboards
[15] - p/chatbubble options for the bubble being on the left, right, and bottom sides of the image
[16] - logs page removes content at the bottom after you've scrolled wayy past it
[17] - rewrite readme.md to include info about stuff like what the lib files do and the forking pattern
[18] - so apparently the end event of collectors is called when the bot is removed from a server so that means you're gonna have to fix a bunch of collectors that rely upon guild ids to remove them from lists
[19] - add some sort of greeting message that tells people the features of the bot
[20] - p/chatbubble can be used by replying, reference can be set with a p/setreference and used from right click > apps > thingy

[26] - `p/queue add sound_file_name` should just work dont need no file:// ✅
