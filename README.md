# The PepperBot Project

It is our goal at PepperBot Industries:tm: to create a quality product for users to enjoy.

ok i'm sorry i just really wanted to say that

basically:\
this is a discord bot\
it was developed for my [discord server](https://discord.gg/UMaFC6tjKu)\
if i'm being honest, i don't know what my goal was\
i just wanted to make a thing\
its literally all just whatever i could come up with to occupy my time

incase you're wondering why some of the code looks so weird, 90% of it is because of me wanting to support both slash commands and message commands

if you would like more detailed update logs than the commit message, join the discord server
